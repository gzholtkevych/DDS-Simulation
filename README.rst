# Project Description
**Project name:** Simulation of Processes in Distributed Data Stores

**Project participants:** Galyna Zholtkevych, Kyrylo Rukkas, and
Grygoriy Zholtkevych (g.zholtkevych@karazin.ua)

**Institution:** Department of Theoretical and Applied Computer Science,
School of Mathematics and Computer Science at V.N. Karazin Kharkiv National
University

**Project has been started at** September, 2016

**The goal of the project:** to develop the simulation framework for study
processes in distributed data stores and establish quantitative laws related
with CAP-theorem.

**Folders and files:**

1. README.md is this file
2. ``models`` is the folder containing model files
   - concepts.uxf contains the conceptual model of the simulation
   - concepts.pdf contains the conceptual model in pdf-format
3. ``papers`` is the folder containing tex-files of papers written during
the project
4. ``dds_simulation`` is the folder containing sources of python modules
implementing the DDS-simulator and other needed python files
